# Homework 3 - Rohan Kathuria

## 1. (40 pts) Disprove the following statement:
> There is an integer $a$ such that $4 \mid\left(a^{2}+1\right)$.
> You may use:
> - the fact that an integer $a$ is either even or odd and not both
> - the Division Algorithm

## 2. ( 30 pts) Let $x$ and $y$ be integers. Prove by contrapositive:
> If $x+y$ and $x y$ are even, then $x$ and $y$ are even.



## 3. ( 30 pts) Prove by contradiction:
> the equation $x^{3}-9=0$ has no rational solution. You may use the fact that if a prime $p$ divides any positive power of an integer $n$, then $p \mid n$.
